### Top 5 Actions for CI Green Path

1. **Remove default admin seed credentials** - Replace with bootstrap flow requiring explicit password
2. **Fix Prettier failures on Helm templates** - Exclude from Prettier or use prettier-plugin-helm
3. **Replace default encryption/JWT secrets** - Require non-default values at startup
4. **Restrict /metrics endpoint** - Add auth or IP allowlist
5. **Address npm audit highs** - Update react-router-dom and vite

### Priority Timeline

| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 1 hour | Fix Helm formatting, remove seed password, lock down /metrics     |
| Same day | Rotate encryption keys, enforce JWT aud/iss, upgrade dependencies |
