## Development Context

### Repository Layout

The monorepo is organized for separation of concerns while enabling code sharing:

- **apps/** - Deployable applications (gateway, web-ui, module backends)
- **packages/** - Shared TypeScript libraries (types, auth, UI components)
- **services/** - Shared Python microservices (centralized functionality)
- **infrastructure/** - Docker, database, observability configurations

### Coding Standards

**TypeScript**

- Strict mode enabled, no `any` types
- Zod for runtime validation at API boundaries
- Fastify plugin pattern for modular routes
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for objects

**Python**

- Type hints on all functions
- Pydantic for data validation
- AsyncIO for all I/O operations
- Structured logging with structlog

**General**

- Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:)
- All PRs require passing CI
- Security scans before merge
- Pre-commit hooks (Husky for TypeScript, pre-commit for Python)

**Testing & Quality**

- Jest for TypeScript unit tests (67+ tests for gateway)
- pytest for Python unit tests
- autocannon for performance benchmarking
- Test coverage enforced (50% minimum)

### Key Dependencies

**Shared across applications:**

- PostgreSQL 15 - Primary data store
- Redis 7 - Caching and sessions
- NATS 2.10 - Event messaging
- HashiCorp Vault - Secrets management

**Observability stack:**

- Prometheus - Metrics collection
- VictoriaMetrics - Long-term metrics storage
- Loki - Log aggregation
- Grafana - Visualization
- Jaeger - Distributed tracing

## Security Context

### Authentication Flow

```
Client → Gateway → Auth Service → Vault (JWT keys)
                        ↓
                   PostgreSQL (users)
                        ↓
                   Redis (sessions)
```

### RBAC Model

| Role     | IPAM       | NPM        | STIG       | Admin |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Admin    | Full       | Full       | Full       | Full  |
| Operator | Read/Write | Read/Write | Read/Write | None  |
| Viewer   | Read       | Read       | Read       | None  |

### Sensitive Data Handling

- Credentials stored in Vault only
- Passwords hashed with Argon2id
- JWT signed with RS256 (production)
- All secrets via environment/Vault (never in code)

## Deployment Context

### Container Strategy

- Multi-stage builds for minimal images
- Non-root users in all containers
- Health checks on all services
- Pinned versions (no :latest)

### Platform Considerations

| Platform | Notes                                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| macOS    | Docker Desktop, host.docker.internal                               |
| RHEL 9   | Podman compatible, SELinux :Z mounts                               |
| Windows  | WSL2 backend, Linux containers, Hyper-V port remapping (see below) |

### Windows Hyper-V Port Compatibility

Windows Hyper-V reserves certain port ranges that conflict with standard service ports. The following port changes are applied for Windows compatibility:

| Service      | Standard Port | Windows Port | Reason                           |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| NATS Monitor | 8222          | 8322         | Avoid Hyper-V reserved 8139-8238 |
| Vault        | 8200          | 8300         | Avoid Hyper-V reserved 8139-8238 |

These port changes are configured in `docker-compose.yml` and apply to all platforms for consistency. Scripts (`preflight.sh`, `windows-smoke-test.ps1`) use the updated ports.

### Container Dependencies

The gateway container includes additional system packages for network scanning:

| Package      | Version | Purpose                             |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| nmap         | 7.97+   | Network discovery and NMAP scanning |
| nmap-scripts | -       | NMAP scripting engine support       |

These are installed in the gateway Dockerfile development stage:

```dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache nmap nmap-scripts && \
    npm install -g tsx pino-pretty
```

**Note**: NMAP fingerprinting (MAC addresses, vendor detection) requires the gateway container to be on the same network segment as scanned hosts. DNS reverse lookup must be configured for hostname resolution.

**Enabling Full Fingerprinting**: By default, the gateway runs on a Docker bridge network which cannot detect MAC addresses for hosts on the physical LAN. To enable MAC address detection:

1. Edit `docker-compose.yml` and uncomment `network_mode: host` in the gateway service
2. Comment out the `networks` and `ports` sections for the gateway
3. Rebuild and restart: `docker compose build gateway && docker compose up -d gateway`

With host network mode, the gateway has direct Layer 2 access to detect MAC addresses and vendor information for hosts on the same subnet.

### Scaling Patterns

- Stateless gateway (horizontal scaling)
- Python workers scale per module
- Redis for session affinity
- PostgreSQL read replicas (future)

## Historical Context

### Migration from Monolithic IPAM

The original IPAM application used:

- SQLite with SQLCipher → PostgreSQL
- Session auth with Argon2id → JWT (kept Argon2id for passwords)
- Jinja2 templates → React SPA

Key learnings:

- VictoriaMetrics needed for time-series (IPAM gap)
- Unified auth reduces complexity
- Message queue enables loose coupling

### NPM as Reference Architecture

NPM was the most successful build and serves as the template:

- Fastify gateway pattern
- React + Vite frontend
- Python async collectors
- Full observability stack

## Future Roadmap

### Near-term (3-6 months)

- Complete platform consolidation
- Cross-module dashboard
- Kubernetes deployment option

### Medium-term (6-12 months)

- API federation (GraphQL gateway)
- Multi-tenant support
- Cloud-native deployment options

### Long-term

- AI-powered anomaly detection
- Automated remediation
- Integration marketplace
