## 🔥 NOW (Active / In Progress)

| ID      | P   | Title                               | Status | Owner  |
| ------- | --- | ----------------------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| APP-016 | 🔴  | Syslog forwarder crash (missing DB) | Open   | DevOps |
| CI-017  | 🔴  | Turbo APIClient TLS/keychain error  | Open   | DevOps |
| APP-017 | 🟠  | E2E tests blocked by artifacts      | Open   | DevOps |

### APP-016: Syslog Forwarder Crash

**Description**: `netnynja-syslog-forwarder` continuously restarts due to missing `syslog.forwarders` table.
**Evidence**: `asyncpg.exceptions.UndefinedTableError: relation "syslog.forwarders" does not exist`
**Resolution**: Apply missing migration or create table, then restart service.

### CI-017: Turbo APIClient TLS/Keychain Error

**Description**: All Turbo-based npm scripts (`lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `build`) fail with TLS error.
**Evidence**: `Failed to create APIClient: Unable to set up TLS. No keychain is available.`
**Resolution**: Disable Turbo remote cache or fix keychain/TLS access configuration.

### APP-017: E2E Tests Blocked

**Description**: E2E test suite cannot run due to artifact creation constraints.
**Evidence**: `tests/e2e/run_tests.sh` creates `.venv` and `tests/e2e/reports/*` directories.
**Resolution**: Approve E2E artifacts or run in disposable environment.

## ⏭️ NEXT (Queued / Ready)

- [ ] Seed E2E users in `shared.users` table
- [ ] Validate VictoriaMetrics write endpoint (preflight warning)
- [ ] Verify NATS stream endpoint JSON format for monitoring
- [ ] Phase 9 — Documentation site deployment (optional)

## ⛔ BLOCKED (Waiting / External Dependency)

- [ ] SEC-011 — zlib CVE-2026-22184 (Critical) - No upstream fix available, monitoring Alpine/Node releases

### Remediation Strategy

**Tier 1: Monitor (No Fix Available)**

- zlib CVE-2026-22184: Subscribe to Alpine Linux security announcements
- Compensating control: Container network isolation, minimal attack surface

**Tier 2: Completed ✅ (2026-01-15)**

- cross-spawn, glob: Fixed by upgrading Vite 5.x → 7.3.1
- @vitejs/plugin-react: 4.2.1 → 5.1.2
- @types/node: 20.10.0 → 20.19.0
- npm audit: 0 vulnerabilities

**Tier 3: Rebuild on Upstream Fix**

- When Alpine releases fixed packages: `docker compose build --no-cache`
- Re-run Docker Scout scan to verify remediation

### Monitoring Checklist

- [x] Subscribe to Alpine Linux security mailing list - https://lists.alpinelinux.org/lists/~alpine/security-announce
- [x] Subscribe to Node.js security announcements - https://nodejs.org/en/about/security
- [ ] Set calendar reminder for weekly vulnerability review
- [ ] Document risk acceptance for CVE-2026-22184 in security register
