## 🔥 NOW (Active / In Progress)

### CI-001: CI/CD Pipeline Validation (In Progress)

**Status**: 🟡 Phase 1 Complete - Awaiting CI/CD Validation
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical - Release Blocker
**Started**: 2026-01-18 14:30 UTC
**Engineer**: Claude (Enterprise IT Security & DevOps Architect)

**Issue**: All 3 GitHub Actions workflows failing for commit f4d536b (multi-STIG config analysis feature)

**Failed Workflows**:

- ❌ Tests #45 (Duration: 1m 21s)
- ❌ Security Scan #80 (Duration: 2m 17s)
- ❌ Build Docker Images #24 (Duration: 11m 17s)

**Root Cause**: npm optional dependency installation failure - Rollup ARM64 native binary missing

**Impact**:

- v0.2.12 release blocked
- Cannot build Docker images
- CI/CD pipeline completely broken

**Phase 1 Resolution (Complete)**:

- ✅ Cleaned node_modules and package-lock.json
- ✅ Cleared npm cache (`npm cache clean --force`)
- ✅ Reinstalled all dependencies (`npm install --ignore-scripts`)
- ✅ Verified build succeeds locally (6/6 packages, 12.4s)
- ✅ Verified tests pass locally (67/67 tests)
- ✅ Created audit trail documentation: `docs/audit/2026-01-18_CI_CD_Failure_Remediation.md`

**Next Steps**:

1. ⏳ Commit dependency fixes with audit documentation
2. ⏳ Push to GitHub and monitor CI/CD pipelines
3. ⏳ Verify all 3 workflows pass in GitHub Actions

**Expected Outcome**: ✅ All CI/CD workflows pass (95% confidence)

**Audit Trail**: See `docs/audit/2026-01-18_CI_CD_Failure_Remediation.md` for complete timeline, root cause analysis, and remediation steps.

## 📋 DEFERRED

### SEC-001: npm Security Vulnerabilities (Deferred to Phase 2)

**Status**: 🟡 Deferred - Non-Blocking
**Priority**: 🟠 High - Security Issue
**Detected**: 2026-01-18 14:50 UTC
**Target Resolution**: Within 48 hours

**Vulnerabilities**:

```
Package: tar (<=7.5.2)
Severity: HIGH
CVE: GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97
Issue: Arbitrary File Overwrite and Symlink Poisoning

Dependency Chain:
argon2@0.27.2-0.31.2 → @mapbox/node-pre-gyp@<=1.0.11 → tar@<=7.5.2

Count: 3 HIGH severity vulnerabilities
```

**Risk Assessment**:

- Exploitability: Medium (requires malicious tar archive processing)
- Impact: High (arbitrary file write, potential RCE)
- Production Exposure: Low (tar not used in runtime code paths)
- Affected Service: auth-service (password hashing)

**Remediation Plan (Phase 2)**:

1. Update argon2 to v0.44.0+ (breaking change)
2. Verify auth service password hashing compatibility
3. Run `npm audit fix --force` and validate
4. Test authentication flows thoroughly

**Justification for Deferral**:

- Build/CI fixes take priority (release blocker)
- Security issues don't block v0.2.12 release
- Low production risk (no tar operations in runtime)
- Will address in separate commit within 48 hours

(none - moved CI-001 to NOW)

## ✅ Recently Resolved (2026-01-18)

### STIG-19: Combined PDF Report for Multi-STIG Config Analysis

**Resolution**: Added combined report generation endpoints and frontend integration:

- New API endpoints: `GET /reports/combined-pdf` and `GET /reports/combined-ckl` accepting comma-separated job_ids
- `ReportGenerator.generate_combined_pdf_from_jobs()` creates single PDF with executive summary + per-STIG sections
- `ReportGenerator.generate_combined_ckl_from_jobs()` creates ZIP with separate CKL files per STIG
- Frontend `AssetsPage.tsx` tracks all job IDs and uses combined endpoints for multi-STIG downloads
- Gateway proxy routes added for combined report endpoints

### STIG-18: Config Analysis Only Analyzes First STIG

**Resolution**: Modified `AssetsPage.tsx` to run config analysis against ALL assigned/enabled STIGs:

- Changed from single-STIG analysis to loop through all enabled definitions
- Aggregates results from all STIGs (total checks, passed, failed, compliance score)
- Stores all job IDs in state for combined report generation
- UI displays consolidated results across all analyzed STIGs

### STIG-17: PDF Description Contains Raw XML Tags

**Resolution**: Added `extract_vuln_discussion()` function to both PDF and CKL exporters:

- Extracts only the `<VulnDiscussion>` content from raw STIG descriptions
- Falls back to stripping all XML tags if no VulnDiscussion tag present
- Added `clean_text_for_pdf()` helper for safe PDF rendering
- Improved PDF format: V-ID, Severity, Status, Title, Description, Fix Text with separators

### STIG-14: Config Analysis Uses Assigned STIGs

**Resolution**: Modified `AssetsPage.tsx` Config Analysis modal to:

- Auto-fetch assigned STIGs when opening the modal
- Display assigned/enabled STIGs instead of requiring manual selection
- Use the first enabled assigned STIG for analysis automatically
- Only show STIG dropdown if no STIGs are assigned to the asset

### STIG-15: PDF Report Full V-ID Details

**Resolution**: Enhanced PDF report generator (`pdf.py`) to include:

- Full description (Vulnerability Discussion) for each failed finding
- Fix Text (Remediation guidance) for each failed finding
- New paragraph styles for description and fix text
- `KeepTogether` blocks to keep findings from breaking across pages
- Report generator now fetches rule details from `definition_rules` table

### STIG-16: CKL Report Full V-ID Details

**Resolution**: Enhanced CKL exporter (`ckl.py`) to:

- Accept `rule_details` dict from database instead of relying on `xccdf_content`
- Populate `Vuln_Discuss`, `Check_Content`, and `Fix_Text` fields from database
- Maintain backwards compatibility with legacy `xccdf_content` fallback

### STIG-500: SSH Credentials 500 Error

**Resolution**: Applied missing migration `008_add_ssh_credentials_sudo.sql` adding sudo columns to `stig.ssh_credentials` table. Gateway was failing because the table lacked `sudo_enabled`, `sudo_method`, `sudo_password_encrypted`, `sudo_user` columns.

### STIG-13: Multi-STIG Assignment API (Backend Completion)

**Resolution**: Added missing Python API endpoint handlers in `apps/stig/src/stig/api/routes.py`:

- `GET /targets/{id}/definitions` - List assigned STIGs
- `POST /targets/{id}/definitions` - Assign STIG
- `POST /targets/{id}/definitions/bulk` - Bulk assign
- `PATCH /targets/{id}/definitions/{id}` - Update assignment
- `DELETE /targets/{id}/definitions/{id}` - Remove assignment
- `POST /targets/{id}/audit-all` - Audit all enabled STIGs
- `GET /audit-groups` - List audit groups
- `GET /audit-groups/{id}` - Get audit group
- `GET /audit-groups/{id}/summary` - Get compliance summary

**Note**: Gateway routes were already complete. Only the Python service backend was missing.

### DOC-001: STIG Selection Guide

**Resolution**: Created `docs/STIG_SELECTION_GUIDE.md` documenting:

- STIG selection logic (role-based approach)
- Juniper SRX STIG package breakdown (NDM, ALG, VPN, IDPS)
- When to apply each STIG based on device functionality
- Multi-STIG UI usage instructions
- Database schema reference

## ⏭️ NEXT (Queued / Ready)

- [ ] Seed E2E users in `shared.users` table
- [ ] Validate VictoriaMetrics write endpoint (preflight warning)
- [ ] Verify NATS stream endpoint JSON format for monitoring
- [ ] Phase 9 — Documentation site deployment (optional)

## ⛔ BLOCKED (Waiting / External Dependency)

- [ ] SEC-011 — zlib CVE-2026-22184 (Critical) - No upstream fix available, monitoring Alpine/Node releases

- npm audit: 0 vulnerabilities

**Tier 3: Rebuild on Upstream Fix**

- When Alpine releases fixed packages: `docker compose build --no-cache`
- Re-run Docker Scout scan to verify remediation

### Monitoring Checklist

- [x] Subscribe to Alpine Linux security mailing list - https://lists.alpinelinux.org/lists/~alpine/security-announce
- [x] Subscribe to Node.js security announcements - https://nodejs.org/en/about/security
